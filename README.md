### Getting started

To get started you'll want to install pipenv then run:
```
pipenv install
```

which will build an environment with tensorflow and all the dependencies you'll be needing to complete this tutorial.

To run the demonstration jupyter notebook:

```
pipenv shell
```

and then, once in the pipenv environment:

```
jupyter lab
```

Open the notebook `epistatic_net_demo.ipynb` and run all cells!
